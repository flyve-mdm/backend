We present you the Flyve MDM Plugin for GLPI. <br/>

We integrated the outstanding features of Flyve MDM into GLPI platform providing you security functionalities for your IT infrastructure.<br/>

Flyve MDM secures all your devices, allowing you to manage your mobile fleet security policy with precision in order to protect sensitive company data stored on mobile devices.<br/>
