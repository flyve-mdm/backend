# Versioning

In order to provide transparency on our release cycle and to maintain backward compatibility, Flyve MDM is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). We are committed to following and complying with the rules, the best we can.

See [the tags section of our GitHub project](http://github.com/flyve-mdm/flyve-mdm-glpi/tags) for changelogs for each release version of Flyve MDM. Release announcement posts on [the official Teclib' blog](http://www.teclib-edition.com/en/communities/blog-posts/) contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.

# Roadmap

We are eager to build together the best software in the IT industry, for mobile device management. In order to help you prioritize what to focus on and to share insights on our priorities, we have published Flyve MDMâ€™s Platform Roadmap. This roadmap is a rough estimate of what we are planning on building in the near-, medium-, and long-term.

Placement on the roadmap represents our estimate of when each project will enter full production release. Some larger features will land in your hands through Early Access programs in advance of their full release.

The items in the roadmap are subject to change or delay, so you should not use this for major planning purposes. We will do our best to keep the roadmap updated, and we will review the roadmap monthly to ensure it reflects our most up-to-date features inventory.

You can follow the progress on the opened and closed issues, opened and closed merge requests, percentage of completion and remaining days, in the following links of every milestone.

# Disclaimer

This roadmap is for informational purposes only, so you shouldn't rely on this information for major purchasing or planning purposes. Just like all projects, the items in the roadmap are subject to change or delay, and the continued development or release of a project on the roadmap is at the sole discretion of Teclib'.
